From the user:,,,,
For lettings where we (SANCTUARY HA - 819) are the managing organisation we currently use extracts from several sources which we merge together:,,,,
Data extracted direct from SAP OneSanctuary,,,,
"Data from SAP OneSanctuary, but extracted via SAP BusinessObjects Web Intelligence",,,,
Data from a sharepoint survey (where we do not collect the data in SAP OneSanctuary),,,,
Reference is also made to offline tables (e.g. which map our property references to CORE management groups/scheme codes). ,,,,
Once the data is merged and mapped to the fields used in the eCORE template this is then uploaded. Any issues with validation are referred to operational staff and manually amended where necesary.,,,,
