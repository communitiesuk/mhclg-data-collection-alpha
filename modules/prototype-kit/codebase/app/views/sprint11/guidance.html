    <p>The continuous recording of lettings and sales in social housing in England (referred to as CORE) is a national information source that records information on the characteristics of both private registered providers and local authority new social housing tenants and the homes they rent.</p>
    <p>This collection provides all of the statistical information that the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government produces on social housing lettings and includes:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>trends in social housing lettings over time</li>
      <li>characteristics of tenants with new social housing lettings</li>
      <li>types of tenancy agreements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Summary information about characteristics of the tenants and the properties are available in the annual statistical releases below.</p>
